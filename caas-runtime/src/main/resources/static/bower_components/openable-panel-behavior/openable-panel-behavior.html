  /**
   * A behavior to implement an element that is aware when it's displayed
   * to the user. It allows to specify an attribute that is used to compute
   * whether the element is opened or closed.
   *
   * The reason to use this behavior is to prohibit any computations that
   * shouldn't be pergormed when the element is not displayed. For example it
   * can be used if route parameters are directly passed to the element and
   * it may perform computation even if router conencted element that controls
   * view disabled the element (hidden it from the view).
   *
   * Elements implementing this behavior have `_isOpened` private property that tells
   * the element if the element is currently in use. This property can be controlled by the
   * `attrForOpened` property. If the property is set and corresponding to it's
   * value attribute is set then the element is considered as opened.
   * Also, if the element doesn't have `attrForOpened` value the `_isOpened`
   * property is set to true.
   *
   * ### Example
   *
   * ```html
   * <iron-pages selected-attribute="opened" selected="0">
   *  <implementation-1 attr-for-opened="opened"></implementation-1>
   *  <implementation-2 attr-for-opened="opened"></implementation-2>
   * </iron-pages>
   * ```
   * In the example, first child of the `<iron-pages>` element has `opened`
   * attribute set. This attribute change is recognized by this element and
   * `_isOpened` attribute value is updated.
   *
   * @polymerBehavior ArcBehaviors.OpenablePanelBehavior

       *
       * This is helpful when this editor is used alongside other payload editors and only one
       * at the time should perform a computation.
       *
       * Note that setting a property instead of attribute will not work. It must be an
       * attribute.
